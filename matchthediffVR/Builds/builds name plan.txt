**this is for personal notes on my build plans**

Pre-Alpha-1.0 starts when the "wait" for music begins.
each puzzle will add 1, file conversion(to c++) will add .1, and bug fixes add .0.1
Alpha-1.0 will begin when there are 5 puzzles per floor, and i am able to "distribute" the product.
each map will add 1, stages will add .1 each, and bug fixes will add .0.1
Beta-1.0 starts with 3 maps, and may require an asset overhaul
same scaling as as alpha.

full release requires a slight rehaul, as story will be required. this will require writing assitance, 
but the main plot should revolve around the reason why the different maps are in different eras/styles, beyond that I got nothing, though it should have stanley parable or view finder vibes.
